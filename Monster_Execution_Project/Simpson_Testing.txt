As the code was being develloped, console printing statements were used to verify that the proper values were present.
This value printing strategy was repeated for each major development of the code until a compulation or system printing error had occured.
Once a error occured, the debugging system of the JetBrains CLion IDE was used to track what went wrong in the code.
Most errors that occured were either improper/loss assignments or segmentation faults.
To identify what lines caused the errors, the debugging trace system paired in conjunction with commenting out every other block of code was used.
This systematic pairing of printing and line-by-line debugging was used to test the validity of the code until the code was completed

To verify that the code's output and input functionality allowed for consitent succes, test cases similar to the sample test case were develloped.
These test cases will verify that the code is robust against smaller alterations in input.
