Rylan Simpson. Sept 27, 2020.

During the creation of the program,
 for each major development milestone, the program was compiled to ensure
 there were not compilation issues.
Upon the completion of the program,
 the debugging tool was utelized to detect any present segmentation faults.
For the removal of remaining bugs,
 print statements detailing the program's current status with a position code
 were placed for each major step in the program's runtime.
During the development and debugging process, a simple "in" file with a single test case
 and two sets of coorinates were known, with a simple expected value to be returned from the program
In the final testing phase of the program, an "in" file with 3 separate test cases was developped
 This test file included increasingly larger test cases -ending with 8 connections-,
 and randomly generated coordinate values.
